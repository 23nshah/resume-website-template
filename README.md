# Sample Resume Website
This repo contains sample HTML and CSS files that are useful if you want to make your own website. It contains:
- `index.html` which has some divs, sample text, links, and buttons. It also features a working navbar for you to use
- `aboutme.html` a blank HTML document for your own use
- `style.css` a sample CSS file with straightforward designs
- `script.js` an empty JS file where you can add your own Javascript implementations

I also suggest installing the Live Server (by Ritwick Dey), which will allow you to dynamically run your website on your local machine. It will automatically update changes as you code, making debugging really easy.
